                                            <li><strong>Prepare the Chenna (Paneer):</strong> In a large pot, gently bring the milk to a boil over medium heat, ensuring occasional stirring to prevent burning. Gradually add lemon juice while stirring until the milk curdles completely. Remove from heat once curdled.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Strain the Curdled Milk:</strong> Line a colander with cheesecloth, positioning it over a bowl. Pour the curdled milk through the cheesecloth to separate the whey from the chenna (paneer). Allow it to sit for a few minutes to enable excess liquid drainage.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Prepare the Rasmalai Balls:</strong> Gather the edges of the cheesecloth and squeeze out any remaining liquid from the chenna. Transfer the chenna to a clean surface and knead it gently for about 5 minutes until it becomes smooth. Divide the chenna into small portions and roll them into smooth balls. Press them gently to flatten slightly.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Cook the Rasmalai Balls:</strong> In a wide pan, mix sugar and water and bring it to a boil over medium heat to make a syrup. Gently drop the prepared chenna balls into the boiling syrup. Cover and let them simmer for about 15-20 minutes, allowing them to double in size and become spongy.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Prepare the Rasmalai:</strong> Once the chenna balls are cooked and have doubled in size, remove them from the syrup using a slotted spoon and place them in a serving dish. Sprinkle cardamom powder over the cooked chenna balls and pour some of the syrup over them. Chill the Rasmalai in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving. Serve chilled and enjoy the creamy, sweet delicacy!</li>

Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the sugar dissolves completely. Once the sugar syrup reaches a one-string consistency, remove it from heat and keep it warm.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Fry the Jalebis:</strong> Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadhai over medium heat. Fill a piping bag fitted with a jalebi nozzle (or a ziplock bag with a small corner cut off) with the prepared batter. Squeeze the batter into the hot oil in a circular motion to form spirals or pretzel-like shapes. Fry the jalebis until they are golden brown and crisp on both sides. Remove them from the oil and drain excess oil by placing them on paper towels.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Soak in Sugar Syrup:</strong> Immediately transfer the fried jalebis to the warm sugar syrup. Let them soak for about 1-2 minutes, ensuring they are fully coated with the syrup. Flip them once or twice to ensure even soaking.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Remove the soaked jalebis from the sugar syrup using a slotted spoon and transfer them to a serving plate. Jalebis are best served warm, so enjoy them fresh with a cup of hot tea or serve them as a dessert. Optionally, garnish with chopped pistachios or almonds for added flavor and presentation.</li>
